<h2 align="center">Collecting Spoons</h2>
<h4 align="center"> I have been collecting spoons since 4th grade. The reason I collect spoons is because there are many different shapes, colors, and sizes of spoons. I have a large veriety of spoons, from metal to plastic spoons. Many peaple (my freinds) call me the spoon wizard, because of my intrest in spoons.</h4>

<h2 align="center">Playing with Freinds</h2>
<h4 align="center">I relly like playing with freinds. I live in a couart, so playing sports, hanginging out, and games are safer and better in a couart. Recently, one of my best freinds from school have moved in next door from me, so playing with freinds has been better.</h4>
<h2 align="center">Playing videogames</h2>
<h4 align="center">Videogames have always been a part of my life, since I was gifted a kindle fire at christmas.</h4>
